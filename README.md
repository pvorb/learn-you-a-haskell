Learn You a _Haskell_ for Great Good!
=====================================

_by Miran Lipovača._

This is my personal copy of “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!”, the prettiest
book for learning Haskell that I know of. I obtained this copy by using
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

You can read the book [online](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) or [buy a
copy](http://nostarch.com/lyah.htm).

Description at learnyouahaskell.com
-----------------------------------

> Hey yo! This is Learn You a Haskell, the funkiest way to learn Haskell, which
> is the best functional programming language around. You may have heard of it.
> This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to
> try functional programming.
>
> The whole thing is completely free to read online, but it's also available in
> print and I encourage you to buy as many copies as you can afford!

> To contact me, shoot me an email to: bonus at learnyouahaskell dot com! You
> can also find me idling on [#haskell](irc://irc.freenode.net/haskell) where I
> go by the name BONUS.

What is this repo for?
----------------------

With the help of this repo, you can make your own ebook version of the book.
Make sure you have Pandoc installed and pdflatex (for making the pdf) and then 
use 'make all', 'make epubs' or 'make pdfs' depending on what you want.
The output will be written to a directory called 'out'
