Types and Typeclasses
=====================

Believe the type
----------------

![moo](../img/cow.png)

Previously we mentioned that Haskell has a static type system. The type
of every expression is known at compile time, which leads to safer code.
If you write a program where you try to divide a boolean type with some
number, it won't even compile. That's good because it's better to catch
such errors at compile time instead of having your program crash.
Everything in Haskell has a type, so the compiler can reason quite a lot
about your program before compiling it.

Unlike Java or Pascal, Haskell has type inference. If we write a number,
we don't have to tell Haskell it's a number. It can *infer* that on its
own, so we don't have to explicitly write out the types of our functions
and expressions to get things done. We covered some of the basics of
Haskell with only a very superficial glance at types. However,
understanding the type system is a very important part of learning
Haskell.

A type is a kind of label that every expression has. It tells us in
which category of things that expression fits. The expression `True` is a
boolean, `"hello"` is a string, etc.

Now we'll use GHCI to examine the types of some expressions. We'll do
that by using the `:t` command which, followed by any valid expression,
tells us its type. Let's give it a whirl.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t 'a'
'a' :: Char
ghci> :t True
True :: Bool
ghci> :t "HELLO!"
"HELLO!" :: [Char]
ghci> :t (True, 'a')
(True, 'a') :: (Bool, Char)
ghci> :t 4 == 5
4 == 5 :: Bool
~~~~

![bomb](../img/bomb.png) Here we see that doing `:t`
on an expression prints out the expression followed by `::` and its type.
`::` is read as "has type of". Explicit types are always denoted with the
first letter in capital case. `'a'`, as it would seem, has a type of `Char`.
It's not hard to conclude that it stands for *character*. `True` is of a
`Bool` type. That makes sense. But what's this? Examining the type of
`"HELLO!"` yields a `[Char]`. The square brackets denote a list. So we read
that as it being *a list of characters*. Unlike lists, each tuple length
has its own type. So the expression of `(True, 'a')` has a type of
`(Bool, Char)`, whereas an expression such as `('a','b','c')` would have the
type of `(Char, Char, Char)`. `4 == 5` will always return `False`, so its type
is `Bool`.

Functions also have types. When writing our own functions, we can choose
to give them an explicit type declaration. This is generally considered
to be good practice except when writing very short functions. From here
on, we'll give all the functions that we make type declarations.
Remember the list comprehension we made previously that filters a string
so that only caps remain? Here's how it looks like with a type
declaration.

~~~~ {.haskell: .hs name="code"}
removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -> [Char]
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']]
~~~~

`removeNonUppercase` has a type of `[Char] -> [Char]`, meaning that it maps
from a string to a string. That's because it takes one string as a
parameter and returns another as a result. The `[Char]` type is synonymous
with `String` so it's clearer if we write
`removeNonUppercase :: String -> String`.
We didn't have to give this function a type declaration because
the compiler can infer by itself that it's a function from a string to a
string but we did anyway. But how do we write out the type of a function
that takes several parameters? Here's a simple function that takes three
integers and adds them together:

~~~~ {.haskell: .hs name="code"}
addThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
addThree x y z = x + y + z
~~~~

The parameters are separated with `->` and there's no special distinction
between the parameters and the return type. The return type is the last
item in the declaration and the parameters are the first three. Later on
we'll see why they're all just separated with `->` instead of having some
more explicit distinction between the return types and the parameters
like `Int, Int, Int -> Int` or something.

If you want to give your function a type declaration but are unsure as
to what it should be, you can always just write the function without it
and then check it with `:t`. Functions are expressions too, so `:t` works
on them without a problem.

Here's an overview of some common types.

`Int` stands for integer. It's used for whole numbers. `7` can be an `Int` but
`7.2` cannot. `Int` is bounded, which means that it has a minimum and a
maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the maximum possible `Int` is
2147483647 and the minimum is -2147483648.

`Integer` stands for, er … also integer. The main difference is that it's
not bounded so it can be used to represent really really big numbers. I
mean like really big. `Int`, however, is more efficient.

~~~~ {.haskell: .hs name="code"}
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial n = product [1..n]
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> factorial 50
30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000
~~~~

`Float` is a real floating point with single precision.

~~~~ {.haskell: .hs name="code"}
circumference :: Float -> Float
circumference r = 2 * pi * r
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> circumference 4.0
25.132742
~~~~

`Double` is a real floating point with double the precision!

~~~~ {.haskell: .hs name="code"}
circumference' :: Double -> Double
circumference' r = 2 * pi * r
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> circumference' 4.0
25.132741228718345
~~~~

`Bool` is a boolean type. It can have only two values: `True` and `False`.

`Char` represents a character. It's denoted by single quotes. A list of
characters is a string.

Tuples are types but they are dependent on their length as well as the
types of their components, so there is theoretically an infinite number
of tuple types, which is too many to cover in this tutorial. Note that
the empty tuple `()` is also a type which can only have a single value: `()`

Type variables
--------------

What do you think is the type of the `head` function? Because `head` takes a
list of any type and returns the first element, so what could it be?
Let's check!

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t head
head :: [a] -> a
~~~~

![box](../img/box.png) Hmmm! What is this `a`? Is it
a type? Remember that we previously stated that types are written in
capital case, so it can't exactly be a type. Because it's not in capital
case it's actually a *type variable*. That means that `a` can be of any
type. This is much like generics in other languages, only in Haskell
it's much more powerful because it allows us to easily write very
general functions if they don't use any specific behavior of the types
in them. Functions that have type variables are called *polymorphic
functions*. The type declaration of `head` states that it takes a list of
any type and returns one element of that type.

Although type variables can have names longer than one character, we
usually give them names of a, b, c, d …

Remember `fst`? It returns the first component of a pair. Let's examine
its type.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t fst
fst :: (a, b) -> a
~~~~

We see that `fst` takes a tuple which contains two types and returns an
element which is of the same type as the pair's first component. That's
why we can use `fst` on a pair that contains any two types. Note that just
because `a` and `b` are different type variables, they don't have to be
different types. It just states that the first component's type and the
return value's type are the same.

Typeclasses 101
---------------

![class](../img/classes.png)

A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a type
is a part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and implements the
behavior the typeclass describes. A lot of people coming from OOP get
confused by typeclasses because they think they are like classes in
object oriented languages. Well, they're not. You can think of them kind
of as Java interfaces, only better.

What's the type signature of the `==` function?

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t (==)
(==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
~~~~

> *Note*: the equality operator, `==` is a function. So are `+`, `*`, `-`, `/` and
> pretty much all operators. If a function is comprised only of special
> characters, it's considered an infix function by default. If we want to
> examine its type, pass it to another function or call it as a prefix
> function, we have to surround it in parentheses.

Interesting. We see a new thing here, the `=>` symbol. Everything before
the `=>` symbol is called a *class constraint*. We can read the previous
type declaration like this: the equality function takes any two values
that are of the same type and returns a `Bool`. The type of those two
values must be a member of the `Eq` class (this was the class constraint).

The `Eq` typeclass provides an interface for testing for equality. Any
type where it makes sense to test for equality between two values of
that type should be a member of the `Eq` class. All standard Haskell types
except for `IO` (the type for dealing with input and output) and functions
are a part of the `Eq` typeclass.

The `elem` function has a type of `(Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool` because it
uses `==` over a list to check whether some value we're looking for is in
it.

Some basic typeclasses:

`Eq` is used for types that support equality testing. The functions its
members implement are `==` and `/=`. So if there's an `Eq` class constraint
for a type variable in a function, it uses `==` or `/=` somewhere inside its
definition. All the types we mentioned previously except for functions
are part of `Eq`, so they can be tested for equality.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> 5 == 5
True
ghci> 5 /= 5
False
ghci> 'a' == 'a'
True
ghci> "Ho Ho" == "Ho Ho"
True
ghci> 3.432 == 3.432
True
~~~~

`Ord` is for types that have an ordering.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t (>)
(>) :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Bool
~~~~

All the types we covered so far except for functions are part of `Ord`.
`Ord` covers all the standard comparing functions such as `>`, `<`, `>=` and
`<=`. The `compare` function takes two `Ord` members of the same type and
returns an ordering. `Ordering` is a type that can be `GT`, `LT` or `EQ`,
meaning *greater than*, *lesser than* and *equal*, respectively.

To be a member of `Ord`, a type must first have membership in the
prestigious and exclusive `Eq` club.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> "Abrakadabra" < "Zebra"
True
ghci> "Abrakadabra" `compare` "Zebra"
LT
ghci> 5 >= 2
True
ghci> 5 `compare` 3
GT
~~~~

Members of `Show` can be presented as strings. All types covered so far
except for functions are a part of `Show`. The most used function that
deals with the `Show` typeclass is show. It takes a value whose type is a
member of `Show` and presents it to us as a string.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> show 3
"3"
ghci> show 5.334
"5.334"
ghci> show True
"True"
~~~~

`Read` is sort of the opposite typeclass of `Show`. The `read` function takes
a string and returns a type which is a member of `Read`.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> read "True" || False
True
ghci> read "8.2" + 3.8
12.0
ghci> read "5" - 2
3
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" ++ [3]
[1,2,3,4,3]
~~~~

So far so good. Again, all types covered so far are in this typeclass.
But what happens if we try to do just `read "4"`?

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> read "4"
<interactive>:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      `Read a' arising from a use of `read' at <interactive>:1:0-7
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
~~~~

What GHCI is telling us here is that it doesn't know what we want in
return. Notice that in the previous uses of `read` we did something with
the result afterwards. That way, GHCI could infer what kind of result we
wanted out of our `read`. If we used it as a boolean, it knew it had to
return a `Bool`. But now, it knows we want some type that is part of the
`Read` class, it just doesn't know which one. Let's take a look at the
type signature of `read`.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t read
read :: (Read a) => String -> a
~~~~

See? It returns a type that's part of `Read` but if we don't try to use it
in some way later, it has no way of knowing which type. That's why we
can use explicit *type annotations*. Type annotations are a way of
explicitly saying what the type of an expression should be. We do that
by adding `::` at the end of the expression and then specifying a type.
Observe:

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> read "5" :: Int
5
ghci> read "5" :: Float
5.0
ghci> (read "5" :: Float) * 4
20.0
ghci> read "[1,2,3,4]" :: [Int]
[1,2,3,4]
ghci> read "(3, 'a')" :: (Int, Char)
(3, 'a')
~~~~

Most expressions are such that the compiler can infer what their type is
by itself. But sometimes, the compiler doesn't know whether to return a
value of type `Int` or `Float` for an expression like `read "5"`. To see what
the type is, Haskell would have to actually evaluate `read "5"`. But since
Haskell is a statically typed language, it has to know all the types
before the code is compiled (or in the case of GHCI, evaluated). So we
have to tell Haskell: "Hey, this expression should have this type, in
case you don't know!".

`Enum` members are sequentially ordered types — they can be enumerated.
The main advantage of the `Enum` typeclass is that we can use its types in
list ranges. They also have defined successors and predecessors, which
you can get with the `succ` and `pred` functions. Types in this class: `()`,
`Bool`, `Char`, `Ordering`, `Int`, `Integer`, `Float` and `Double`.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> ['a'..'e']
"abcde"
ghci> [LT .. GT]
[LT,EQ,GT]
ghci> [3 .. 5]
[3,4,5]
ghci> succ 'B'
'C'
~~~~

`Bounded` members have an upper and a lower bound.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> minBound :: Int
-2147483648
ghci> maxBound :: Char
'\1114111'
ghci> maxBound :: Bool
True
ghci> minBound :: Bool
False
~~~~

`minBound` and `maxBound` are interesting because they have a type of
`(Bounded a) => a`. In a sense they are polymorphic constants.

All tuples are also part of `Bounded` if the components are also in it.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> maxBound :: (Bool, Int, Char)
(True,2147483647,'\1114111')
~~~~

`Num` is a numeric typeclass. Its members have the property of being able
to act like numbers. Let's examine the type of a number.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t 20
20 :: (Num t) => t
~~~~

It appears that whole numbers are also polymorphic constants. They can
act like any type that's a member of the `Num` typeclass.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> 20 :: Int
20
ghci> 20 :: Integer
20
ghci> 20 :: Float
20.0
ghci> 20 :: Double
20.0
~~~~

Those are types that are in the `Num` typeclass. If we examine the type of
`*`, we'll see that it accepts all numbers.

~~~~ {.haskell: .ghci name="code"}
ghci> :t (*)
(*) :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
~~~~

It takes two numbers of the same type and returns a number of that type.
That's why `(5 :: Int) * (6 :: Integer)` will result in a type error
whereas `5 * (6 :: Integer)` will work just fine and produce an `Integer`
because `5` can act like an `Integer` or an `Int`.

To join `Num`, a type must already be friends with `Show` and `Eq`.

`Integral` is also a numeric typeclass. `Num` includes all numbers,
including real numbers and integral numbers, `Integral` includes only
integral (whole) numbers. In this typeclass are `Int` and `Integer`.

`Floating` includes only floating point numbers, so `Float` and `Double`.

A very useful function for dealing with numbers is `fromIntegral`. It has
a type declaration of `fromIntegral :: (Num b, Integral a) => a -> b`.
From its type signature we see that it takes an integral number and
turns it into a more general number. That's useful when you want
integral and floating point types to work together nicely. For instance,
the `length` function has a type declaration of `length :: [a] -> Int`
instead of having a more general type of
`(Num b) => length :: [a] -> b`.
I think that's there for historical reasons or something, although in
my opinion, it's pretty stupid. Anyway, if we try to get a length of a
list and then add it to `3.2`, we'll get an error because we tried to add
together an `Int` and a floating point number. So to get around this, we
do `fromIntegral (length [1,2,3,4]) + 3.2` and it all works out.

Notice that `fromIntegral` has several class constraints in its type
signature. That's completely valid and as you can see, the class
constraints are separated by commas inside the parentheses.
